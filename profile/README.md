## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**Sprout Lab** is a Homelab and Digital Garden built by [@gitasaur](https://github.com/gitasaur). I only use Open Source Software, so what I've built can be used by anyone for free, with the config located publically here to allow others to view and learn.

### What is a Homelab?

A homelab is a private space where individuals can experiment with and learn about various technologies. It's like a personal mini data center where you can build and manage networks, servers, and other IT infrastructure from the comfort of your home. Homelabs are great for testing new software, setting up virtual environments, and honing your IT skills without the limitations of a production environment.

### What is a Digital Garden?

A Digital Garden is a curated collection of notes, ideas, and projects that grow and evolve over time. Unlike a traditional blog, a Digital Garden is more informal and dynamic, allowing for continuous updates and connections between concepts. It's a space where I can document my learning journey, share insights, and develop ideas in a more organic way.

### Who is [@gitasaur](https://github.com/gitasaur)?

I'm Marcus, an engineer who enjoys learning about open source software and helping folks with their software careers. With over 10 years of experience in software, I'm passionate about exploring new tools and technologies, especially in the realms of OSS, cybersecurity, cloud computing, and AI. I'm also an advocate for environmental sustainability and ethical tech practices.

Here are some key points about me:
- **Software Engineer & UX Designer**: I love building intuitive and user-friendly applications.
- **Music Enthusiast**: In my free time, I create music and build synthesisers.
- **Lifelong Learner**: I'm always on the lookout for new technologies and methodologies to expand my knowledge and skills.

Feel free to explore my little homelab setup, ask questions, or offer improvements ðŸ˜Š
